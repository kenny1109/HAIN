 What day do you need the car? 
 I don't have to be back to work for a few days so I need to have it Thursday next week. 
 Just a few details and then I can help locate a car for you. Where would you like to pick up the car, at what time, and when will you be returning the car? 
 I can pick it up around 5 in the evening on March 11th in San Jose. 
 I see that SJC International Airport has a standard Camry available for pickup on March 7th. 
 Great, I am also in the market for a new apartment in that area. 
 I can help with that as well, first tell me the number of bedrooms you need. 
 I need a room for myself and kids so three. 
 The first apartment out of the 10 I have found is located at 1546 Maurice Lane and is called 888 Golden Saratoga-Cupertino Apartment Homes, with 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and costs $4,450 a month. 
 That's a bit out of my price range. What else do you have. 
 The one called Aegena, located at 1290 San Tomas Aquino Road with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms may fit your budget better at $3,500 a month. 
 That one sounds better. Let's schedule a walk through on the 8th. 
 Okay, so you would like me to schedule a walk through at Aegena on March 8th, correct? 
 Yes, that's great. 
 I am happy to report that I was able to schedule that for you. 
 I should have asked before, but do they allow pets of any kind? 
 Yes, they advertise that they do allow pets. 
 Can you also tell me if the apartments are furnished and I will also need a contact number for their office. 
 The apartment's with the phone number 408-984-8888 are not furnished. 
 That's fine. Can we get back to booking that rental car you previously found? 
 Yes, the information I have for the rental car is a standard car being picked up from SJC International Airport, on March 7th at 5 pm, and dropping it back off on March 11th. Is that all still correct? 
 Yes, and how much will that cost me? 
 The car reservation I have just confirmed for you will come to a grand total of $136. 
 Great, you were extremely helpful.

 No, that will be all for now. Thanks again.
